Title: Triangle: A 2D Quality Mesh Generator and Delaunay Triangulator
Author: David C. Sterratt <david.c.sterratt@ed.ac.uk>

Depends: R (>= 2.9.0)
Description: This is a port of Jonathan Shewchuk's Triangle library to R. From his description: "Triangle generates exact Delaunay triangulations, constrained Delaunay triangulations, conforming Delaunay triangulations, Voronoi diagrams, and high-quality triangular meshes. The latter can be generated with no small or large angles, and are thus suitable for finite element analysis."
