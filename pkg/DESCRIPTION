Title: Triangle - A 2D Quality Mesh Generator and Delaunay Triangulator
Author: Jonathan Shewchuk, David C. Sterratt <david.c.sterratt@ed.ac.uk>
Description: This is a port of Jonathan Shewchuk's Triangle library to
    R. From his description: "Triangle generates exact Delaunay
    triangulations, constrained Delaunay triangulations, conforming
    Delaunay triangulations, Voronoi diagrams, and high-quality
    triangular meshes. The latter can be generated with no small or
    large angles, and are thus suitable for finite element analysis."
