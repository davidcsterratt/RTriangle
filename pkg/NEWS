CHANGES IN VERSION 1.6-0.6  - Released 2014-08-08

LICENCE CHANGE

* The licence has changed from a combination of GPL-2 (for R code) and
  Schewchuk's Triangle licence to CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. This change was
  prompted by the CRAN maintainers and is due to Schewchuk's licence
  not being a FOSS licence.

* Fix for Issue #2358: 	RTriangle_1.6-0.5.tar.gz does not pass 'R CMD check' on Windows	
  (https://r-forge.r-project.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2358&group_id=1077&atid=4271)
